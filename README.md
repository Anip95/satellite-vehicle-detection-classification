# Terrestrial Vehicle Detection and Classification in Satellite Images

This project was developed for the *Cognitive Computing Systems* course as part of my academic work as a master's degree student in Computer Engineering.

The work focuses on using a YOLOv11-based model to detect and classify terrestrial vehicles from high-resolution satellite images.
